## Understanding http and the use of curl.
---
Http is an application layer protocol that runs on the tcp/ip suite.
The protocol allows supported applications, clients and servers to share resources
using plain text messages sent over a reliable tunnel, using a reliable transport layer protocol often the tcp.
Messages are routed by ip, that defines addressing scheme for ip networks and routes messages across networks.
Http is stateless but extensible, so the use of headers allow it to implement certain capabilities such as state keeping, through cookies.
